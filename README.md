## Data source
- [Zhejiang Disease Prevention and Control Center](http://www.cdc.zj.cn/)

- Time Period: 2009-2013

- Population: Multidrug resistant tuberculosis patients (MDR-TB)

## Methods
- Conducted a prospective observational cohort. MDR-TB patients were prescribed treatments by infectious disease specialists. Sociodemographic characteristics were obtained through a structured questionnaire. 

- Examined treatment outcomes, literally cure rate.

- Assessed risk factors for poor treatment outcomes using a Cox proportional hazards model.

- Built a mathematical model to predict MDR-TB incidence in Zhejiang by 2050.
